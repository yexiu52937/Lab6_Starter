"description": "This video will show you how to make a Mojito. To many people, the Mojito represents the perfect rum cocktail. The origins of the drink can be traced back to Cuba and the 16th-century Cuban cocktail El Draque, named for Sir Francis Drake.\r\nAppropriately, almost all of the ingredients in the Mojito are indigenous to Cuba. Rum, lime, mint and sugar (derived from cane juice) are mixed with soda water to create a refreshing classic cocktail.",

I used Caribbean coconut rum, and I also took a Serrano 1 slice cut into fourths, and added it with the mint & muddled the two with simple syrup” Home made” and only use fresh lime juice! I love growing my own mint, limes, & lemons for some amazing cocktails!! Yes we grow our own peppers too ❤️ Enjoy"

So I took a bunch of the mint tea bags and made some super strong \"mint water\" then I use the water to make simple syrup. Now I just skip the mint leaf and use my mint simple syrup to mix up a quick mojito. And the shelf life is great."
